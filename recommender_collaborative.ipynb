    "# Recommender system - personalized collaborative recommender module\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction ##\n",
    "With user x restaurant rating matrix, a collaborative recommender module is built here to recommend restaurants that are highly rated by users sharing similar preference.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the Yelp dataset has a total of 1,518,169 users, 188,593 businesses and 5,996,995 reviews, resulting in a very sparse user x restaurant matrix (99.997% empty). Therefore, matrix factorization algorithm is chosed for matrix completion and generate recommendations.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary ##\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Various matrix factorization algorithms are experimented: (section \\#2)\n",
    "\n",
    "* SVD (single value decomposition): The user x business matrix is factorized into user latent matrix and business latent matrix using single value decomposition algorithm.\n",
    "* SVD with bias: a user bias vector and a business bias vector are introduced to the original SVD. The user x business matrix is factorized into user latent matrix, business latent matrix, plus the two bias vector terms; the predicted rating can then be calculated as user_matrix x business_matrix + user_bias + business_bias + global_mean.\n",
    "* NMF (non-negative matrix factorization): The user x business matrix is factorized into non-negative user latent matrix and non-negative business latent matrix using non-negative matrix factorization algorithm. Different from SVD, all the fitted values in the user and business latent matrix are non-negative. \n",
    "* NMF with bias terms: similar to SVD with bias, a user bias vector and a business bias vector are introduced to the original NMF. The user x business matrix is factorized into non-negative user latent matrix, non-negative business latent matrix, plus the two bias vector terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of starting from scratch, both scikit-surprise package and scikit-learn are used to handle many of the implementation details. In particular, the scikit-surprise package is a toolkit built on scikit-learn for building and analyzing recommender systems in particular, and it covers all the four algorithms above. In addition, the NMF module from sklearn.decomposition is also used for prototyping the basic NMF algorithm. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The prototyping results suggest that among the four, both SVD with bias and the basic NMF (no bias) provide reasonable rating predictions, SVD with bias being the most flexible and best performing among all.<br> \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Optimization and Evaluation of matrix factorization using SVD with bias:  (section \\#3)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gridsearch CV:** <br>\n",
    "Based on the insights from prototyping, both SVD with bias model and basic NMF model are further optimized via gridsearch cross validation. The SVD with bias model with the optimized parameters give the best RMSE results.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**RMSE of the best model:**<br>\n",
    "RMSEs of the best model are 1.277, 1.244, and 1.188, for testset with new user/business, testset with no new user/business, and testset with only user/business of more than 5 historical ratings, respectively.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**NDCG of the best model:**<br>\n",
    "Recommendation ranking can be generated for all users in testset based on the predicted ratings from the best model. To evaluate the ranking quality, NDCG (normalized discounted cumulative gain) scores (NDCG@10 and NDCG@5) are computed, with the average NDCG@10 and NDCG@5 scores being 0.905 and 0.908, respectively, higher than the average NDCG scores (~0.86) obtained by the content-based recommender module.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Implementation & testing of the collaborative recommender module: (section \\#4)\n",
    "\n",
    "The best-performing SVD with bias maxtrix factorization model are chosen for implementing the collaborative recommender module. Prior to implementation, the model with the optimized parameters is re-trained taking advantage of the entire review dataset and saved to file for later use in the module.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementaion of content-based recommender module:**<br> \n",
    "The user latent feature matrix and bias vector, the business latent feature and bias vector, along with other necessary information of the trained SVD with bias model are loaded into the module first; given the user_id of interest, personalized ratings are predicted for all businesses in the catalog and paired with corresponding business_id; the list of predicted ratings are then filtered to unrated businesses only based on the user_id of interest, and merged with the restaurant recommendation list based on business_id to filter out non-restaurant businesses; lastly, the resulting recommendation is ranked by predicted rating in descending order to produce the final recommendation for the given user.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing:**<br>\n",
    "Module testing shows that the average time for computing and returning the recommendation for a given user only takes 2 seconds. The returned results are indeed personalized based on similar users, and the module can also return a general recommendation for new users.<br>"

This enables an unique predicted rating for each business even for unseen users. As shown, the rating distribution for unseen users is centered around 3-4.5 with a mean of 3.68 and a range of 1.11-5.05. This is a very realistic range and the mean matches well with the global mean rating of 3.74 as well."

    "As shown, even for users with more review history where the module needs to filter and remove all the rated restaurants from the recommendation list, it only takes 2 seconds to return the personalized recommendation rank. Thanks to the rich personal preference history, the recommendation is really personalized. As in this case, it seems to suggest that the user prefers restaurants with a rich number of reviews (popular restaurants), reasonable to good ratings (3.5-4.5) and near the Las Vegas and Arizona area. Different from content-based module, recommendation by the collaborative module features quite a variety of cuisines. "
